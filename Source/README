User Controls:

ESCAPE key       -> Exits the application.
'm' key          -> Toggles orthogonal overhead projection, first person perspective
                    projection and debug mode.
'r' key          -> (First person mode only) Resets eye and center point position.
'l' key          -> Toggles automatic light movement (orbit scene).
'p' key          -> (If light orbit disabled) Increments the light source's position
                    along the orbit path, enabling manual control of light movement.
'o' key          -> Toggles vertical/horizontal light source orbit.
's' key          -> (Debug mode only) Toggle between objects displayed in debug mode.
RIGHT ARROW key  -> (Orthogonal projection/debug) : Increments view azimuth by 5 degrees.
                    (First person projection) : Turns eye/camera 5 degrees right.
LEFT ARROW key   -> (Orthogonal projection/debug) : Decrements view azimuth by 5 degrees.
                    (First person projection): Turns eye/camera 5 degrees left.
UP ARROW key     -> (Orthogonal projeciton/debug) : Increments view elevation by 5 degrees.
                    (First person projection) : Moves eye/camera forward.
DOWN ARROW key   -> (Orthogonal projection/debug) : Decrements view elevation by 5 degrees.
                    (First person projection) : Moves eye/camera backward.

Hubcap image was my own (took a photo of my car's tire from the side).
Rusty metal was my own (took a photo of my apartment's dumpster).
Dirt image was my own (took a photo of my aparment yard).

Sources (Code):

I continued to iterate on the scene in 3d that I have submitted for the previous few assignments.
In addition, I borrowed several snippets of code on texture mapping from the following in-class
examples: ex14 and ex19.  These snippets are labeled with appropriate comments in the code.  I also
utilized the CSCI-x229 library for certain functionality.  Finally, I used the structure from the
in-class examples generally for the following functions: main, idle, reshape, and DrawTriangles, 
as well as the general makefile structure.  I
also used the struct typedefs for the vtx and tri structs from ex13.  

Notes:

Although the steel grating texture that I used for the tail fins is not particularly aerodynamic,
I selected this texture because the smoother metal texture images I was able to find were too subtle
to be clearly noticable when applied to shapes.  Additionally, I used some images from the internet
to convert to 3x8 RGB bitmaps for use in this assignment (see the above section for image sources). 
Whenever I could I tried to use images that I took myself, but with how insanely busy my schedule
is this week, it was not feesible to do so for every texture (unless I wanted to make completely
nonsensical textures like wooden rockets, etc.).  For textures in the final project, I plan to source
all images myself, however.

Estimated time:

Code - Approximately 8 hours
Image Collection - Approximately 2 hours (it's hard to find images that are royalty-free and
                   not obscured by watermarks as well as find decent lighting for outdoor photos).
