Sources (Code):

   The transformation matrices that I used in converting Camera eye coordinates from the world
   coordinate system to object coordinate systems (used in the collision functions for each object)
   was retrieved from my old coursework in my Intro to Robotics class from last semester.  The 
   inverse matrix that I used to convert back to world coordinates after the collision was resolved
   was computed by the Symbolab online calculator.  Additionally, I found some resources on
   StackExchange to help me understand texture blending (specifically to make the translucent
   glass texture on my lantern object).  I didn't borrow any code from this thread, but the question
   and some of the answers helped me get the effect to look semi-decent.
   Thread address: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24399431/opengl-texture-with-transparency-alpha
   I also got the idea to tessalate the larger polygons in my objects to get the spotlight effect to
   look better from the following source: https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter05.html.
   Lastly, the code for generating trees was borrowed from the in-class notes about creating trees
   using fractals.  I made a few minor modifications for optimization so that I could have a large
   quantity of trees rendering at one time.
     

Sources (Textures):
   All textures used in this project were sourced by me, using my phone camera except for two.  The skybox
   texture was retrieved from: https://pixabay.com/illustrations/stars-night-dark-sky-space-3750824/
   I intended to source the skybox texture myself, however I do not own any professional photography
   equipment, and my phone was not able to get a decent quality picture of the night sky.
   The metal texture used for the Cabin doorhandle and hinges was sourced from the following address:
   https://pixabay.com/illustrations/metal-background-steel-brushed-1212115/
   Similar to the night sky texture, I was unable to get a good picture of a "shiny" metal surface
   without negatively affecting the lighting (any light reflected off of the metal surface that was picked 
   up by my phone camera ruined the effect of the lighting in-application).
